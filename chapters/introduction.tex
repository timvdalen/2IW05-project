This document presents a formal specification for the 'Doodle' meeting website for the 2012 fall 2IW05 software specification course.

We will follow a normal iterative approach (with only two iterations for two deliverables) where we will first extract use cases from the informal specification and use them to analyse the informal specification. Then we will use this analysis to form a system design.
