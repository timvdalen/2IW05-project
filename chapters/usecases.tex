\label{sec:usecases}
This section describes the use cases of the system. These use cases only cover the basics like creating and managing events and responding to event invites.

A more complete, real-world system could benefit from additions as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a comment system that allows people to discuss event details.
	\item a richer environment for event organizers that includes a picture gallery.
	\item a notification system on the website.
	\item integration with event features from popular social networks.
	\item more options for inviting people (for instance, allow invitees to invite new people for public events).
	\item allowing closed events to be reopened (and in general a more flexible event system).
\end{itemize}

									\item The user is able to see the votes of other invitees.
								\end{enumerate}
					\item[Alternatives]\textbf{:}\\
								\begin{itemize}
									%TODO: Not sure if an alternative is really the way to go. I used to have a seperate use case for accepting and declining, but that seemed a bit superfluous.
									\item 1.1 If the user doesn't want to participate in the event, he or she declines the invitation.	The use case is ended
									\item 2.1 If the organizer made any voting restrictions, such as enabling users to only vote once or limiting the number of invitees that can vote on a certain date/time, these are enforced. They will continue to step 3.
									\item 4.1 If the poll was marked 'hidden' by the organizer, the results are not shown. The use case is ended.
